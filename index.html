							<p>The Roundup lawsuit involves numerous legal actions against Bayer AG, the company that
								owns Monsanto,
								the original producer of Roundup, a widely used glyphosate-based herbicide. Plaintiffs
								in these cases
								allege that exposure to Roundup caused them to develop non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and
								other cancers,
								claiming that Monsanto knew about the potential risks but failed to warn
								consumers.Roundup was first
								introduced by Monsanto in the 1970s and quickly became one of the most popular
								herbicides globally due
								to its effectiveness in killing weeds. Its active ingredient, glyphosate, works by
								inhibiting an enzyme
								essential for plant growth.;
